                <h2 class="a1">1. Understand your customers</h2>
                <p class="b1">Before you even start to create content for your website,
                    you should consider who your buyer personas are. Think about what their motivations are,
                    what problems they are trying to resolve,
                    what their objections to purchase might be and what exactly it is that will make them choose you.
                    HubSpot offers you a great template to organise your customer research and create your own buyer
                    personas. You can then use these buyer persona outlines to inform the writing of your service
                    descriptions to ensure they are completely customer-centric.</p>
                <h2 class="a1">2. Features vs benefits</h2>
                <p class="b1">Create a list of the features of your services and then list how they transfer to
                    benefits. A benefit might be something that you help customers achieve,
                    or something negative that you can help them avoid. In other words,
                    how is your service going to make the customer feel,
                    or what are they going to gain? Think about how your service makes their life better,
                    easier,
                    more cost-efficient or more enjoyable and use these ideas to make your text more enticing</p>
                <h2 class="a1">3. Connect with customer pain point</h2>
                <p class="b1">Using the information about your personas,
                    identify your customers’ key pain points and how your services will help them overcome these
                    concerns. This will help you create a more persuasive pitch as readers will quickly relate to how
                    your service is the solution they need.</p>
                <p class="b1">Speak directly to the reader. Engage with them by shifting the focus on to them,
                    rather than your company. Use sentences that feature ‘you’ and ‘your’ rather than ‘we’,
                    ‘I’ or ‘us’.</p>
