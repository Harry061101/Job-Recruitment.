                <p class="b1">A company’s culture is the character and personality of an organization. It refers to how
                    people interact, collaborate, and get along within the workplace. Though it may sound somewhat
                    ambiguous, a positive culture is extremely important for many reasons. It attracts talent, increases
                    engagement, and helps ensure employees are happy, productive, and planning to stick around.</p>
                <p class="b1">A great company culture is no longer just a nice-to-have—it’s essential to building a
                    workplace that your current and potential employees want to be a part of. One of the first steps to
                    building a great company culture is knowing what values you would like to instill and how you would
                    describe your organization’s identity</p>
                <p class="b1">Below, we’ll share different words to describe company culture, complete with examples of
                    organizations that embody some of these characteristics today. We’ll also share a few negative words
                    to describe the type of company culture you’re trying to avoid.</p>
