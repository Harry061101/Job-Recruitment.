            <h2 class="a1">1. Keep it concise</h2>
            <p class="b1"> Today’s web surfer has a short attention span. The home page copy needs to cut to the chase
                or risk losing the reader. Don’t waste a lot of time giving details and background.</p>

            <p class="b1">Tell the visitor what your website is all about right off the top. The copywriting should be
                concise and focused. A good size is 200 to 300 words. That should give you enough space to tout your
                biggest benefits and also encompass those all-important keywords. Save lengthy, detailed copy for inner
                pages </p>

            <p class="b1">According to CXL, a company that specializes in online conversions, the exact right length
                depends on things like “what you want your visitors to accomplish on the page, what information they
                need to make a decision to take action, or how aware they are of the solutions that exist to their
                problems.
            </p>
            <h2 class="a1">2. Use keywords</h2>
            <p class="b1">Search engines use keywords to determine where to place you in their directories. Make sure
                you write your home page to include the words you most associate with your business and, more
                importantly, that your prospects likely associate with your business. You need words, the right words.
                That’s why flash sites and graphics-only sites do not perform as well on search engines as sites with
                keyword-rich copy.</p>
            <p class="b1">Take some time to brainstorm what keyword phrases best describe your offerings. Don’t know
                what search queries might be used to reach your site? Go to www.wordtracker.com where you can actually
                test your keywords and get suggestions for related terms.</p>
            <h2 class="a1">3. Write copy from the visitor’s perspective</h2>
            <p class="b1"> First, you must know your visitors. What is most likely to interest them? Visitors are
                looking for the answer to the question, “What’s in it for me?” They don’t want to read company profiles
                or lengthy corporate histories. They may want to learn more later, but initially they want to know that
                you’re offering something that they want.</p>
            <p class="b1"> Here’s a quick test you can do to see if your copy is reader-oriented. Count how many times
                you use the terms “I” and “we.” Next count how many times you use the terms “you” and “your.” If the
                “I’s” and “we’s” outnumber the “you’s” and “yours,” you’re likely to lose your reader.</p>
